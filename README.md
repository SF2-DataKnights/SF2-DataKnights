Problem Statement

Application layer security algorithms are not available/developed for providing application level security for use in Indian Army military software system and application. Encryption is carried out at physical level thereby restricting proliferation of software application. Moreover non availability of application layer security is negatively impinging upon  software security needs and proliferation of application software on Army Data Network.



Proposed Solution:

We have planned to create a platform that incorporates all these three different features which are used in different levels of application layer security into a  single framework. The three features are:
Random Encryption
Risk-based Authentication 
Adaptive Access Control

Note:
These are the current working files for our proposed solution.
